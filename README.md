# YouTube's API Search 

Designed to be a solution for searching YouTube's videos.

## Getting Started

This project was developed exclusively using Python. To make use of it, simply execute the youtube_api_search.py script, soon after the process will begin.

### Prerequisites

Python 3 must be installed beforehand.

### Installing

The first step will be cloning or downloading this repository.

Secondly, Google APIs need an exclusive DEV KEY in order to access their APIs, therefore, after getting it, head over to the script's code and change the content of the DEV_KEY variable to your own.
If you don't have one, your DEV_KEY can be created/found in: https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/guide/aaa_apikeys

Thirdly, execute the script with *python3 youtube_api_search.py*, answer the prompts and everything shall take it's place.

All of the results will be presented on the terminal.
